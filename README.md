# libdmdutil

A cross platform library for performing DMD tasks.

This library is currently used by [Visual Pinball Standalone](https://github.com/vpinball/vpinball/tree/standalone) for processing [PinMAME](https://github.com/vpinball/pinmame/tree/master/src/libpinmame) and [FlexDMD](https://github.com/vbousquet/flexdmd) DMD frames. It supports colorizing using [Serum](https://github.com/zesinger/libserum), outputing to [ZeDMD](https://github.com/ppuc/zedmd) and [Pixelcade](https://pixelcade.org) devices, and providing intensity and RGB24 buffers that can be used to render in table and external DMDs for [Visual Pinball](https://github.com/vpinball/vpinball).

## Usage:

```cpp
#include "DMDUtil/DMDUtil.h"
.
.
void setup()
{
   DMDUtil::Config* pConfig = DMDUtil::Config::GetInstance();
   pConfig->SetZeDMD(true);
   pConfig->SetZeDMDDevice("/dev/cu.usbserial-0001");
   pConfig->SetPixelcadeDMD(false);
}

void test()
{
   DMDUtil::DMD* pDmd = new DMDUtil::DMD();
   pDmd->FindDisplays();

   DMDUtil::RGB24DMD* pRGB24DMD = pDmd->CreateRGB24DMD(128, 32);

   uint8_t* pData = (uint8_t*)malloc(128 * 32 * 3);
   .
   .
   .
   pDmd->UpdateRGB24Data((const UINT8*)pData, 128, 32);

   uint8_t* pRGB24Data = pRGB24DMD->GetRGB24Data();

   if (pRGB24Data) {
      // Render pRGB24Data
   }

   pDmd->DestroyRGB24DMD(pRGB24DMD);
}
```

## dmdserver

`dmdserver` provides a server process on top of `libdmdutil`.
Per default it listens on port 6789 on localhost and accepts "raw" TCP connections.

`dmdserver` accepts these command line options:
* -c --config
    * Config file
    * optional
    * default is no config file
* -o --alt-color-path
    * "Fixed alt color path, overwriting paths transmitted by DMDUpdates
    * optional
* -a --addr
    * IP address or host name
    * optional
    * default is `localhost`
* -p --port
    * Port
    * optional
    * default is `6789`
* -w --wait-for-displays
    * Don't terminate if no displays are connected
    * optional
    * default is to terminate the server process if no displays could be found
* -l --logging
    * Enable logging to stderr
    * optional
    * default is no logging
* -v --verbose
    * Enables verbose logging, includes normal logging
    * optional
    * default is no logging
* -h --help
    * Show help

`dmdserver` expects two packages to render a DMD frame. The first one is a DmdStream header followed by the "data".

The DmdStreamHeader is defined as a struct:
```cpp
  struct DMDUtil::DMD::StreamHeader
  {
    char header[10] = "DMDStream"; // \0 terminated string
    uint8_t version = 1;
    Mode mode = Mode::Data;        // int
    uint16_t width = 0;
    uint16_t height = 0;
    uint8_t buffered = 0;          // 0 => not buffered, 1 => buffered
    uint8_t disconnectOthers = 0;  // 0 => no, 1 => yes
    uint32_t length = 0;
  };

```

The data package is a simple byte stream. It's data format has to match `StreamHeader.mode`.
At the moment, three data modes are supported (If you don't use C++, you could use uint_32 / int instead):
1. `Mode::Data`, int 1
2. `Mode::RGB24`, int 2, also known as RGB888
3. `Mode::RGB16`, int 3, also known as RGB565

`Mode::RGB24` is a uint8_t data stream of `StreamHeader.length`.
Each pixel consist of three uint8_t bytes representening the colors R, G and B.
`StreamHeader.width` and `StreamHeader.height` have to be provided in the header.
`StreamHeader.name` and `StreamHeader.path` should be ignored and set to a fixed size of zeros.

`Mode::RGB216` is a uint16_t data stream of `StreamHeader.length`.
Each pixel consist of one uint16_t having its color encoded in 16bit according to the RGB565 standard.
`StreamHeader.width` and `StreamHeader.height` have to be provided in the header.
`StreamHeader.name` and `StreamHeader.path` should be ignored and set to a fixed size of zeros.

`Mode::Data` is a serialized stream of the `DMDUtil::DMD::Update` struct.
It will be sent from a client which uses libdmdutil itself (for example VPX Standalone or PPUC).
In case of `Mode::Data`, `StreamHeader.width`, `StreamHeader.height` and `StreamHeader.length` should be set to zero.
There will be an additional `AltColorHeader` header sent before the data to the transmit the ROM name and the altcolor path
in case Serum colorization should be used.
The data itself contains a lot of additional data like instructions to map alphanummeric displays to DMDs or colorizations of
grayscale content.

So if you want to write a general purpose client to display images or text, you're adviced to use `Mode::RGB24` or `Mode::RGB216`!

The `buffered` flag set to `1` means that the current data not just gets displayed, but also buffered for later use.
As soon as some buffered data exists, it will be displayed instead of a black screen if a client disconnects.

The `disconnectOthers` flag set to `1` means that any other client get disconnected except the most recent one.
The gets handled only once per connection and only for the most recent one.

### Notes

At the moment, `StreamHeader.length` is a redundant information as it could be calculated from `StreamHeader.width` and
`StreamHeader.height` in combination with `StreamHeader.mode`.
But if data compression will be supported in future versions, it will become important.

### Examples

To send a RGB24 image of 4x2 pixels, you have to sent these two packages, a header package and a payload package:

```
0x44 0x4d 0x44 0x53 0x74 0x72 0x65 0x61 0x6d 0x00  // "DMDStream"
0x01                                               // Version 1
0x02 0x00 0x00 0x00                                // Mode::RGB24 (if your system is big endian, the byte order needs to be swapped)
0x04 0x00                                          // width 4 (if your system is big endian, the byte order needs to be swapped)
0x02 0x00                                          // height 2 (if your system is big endian, the byte order needs to be swapped)
0x00                                               // not buffered
0x00                                               // don't disconnect others
0x18 0x00 0x00 0x00                                // payload length 24 (if your system is big endian, the byte order needs to be swapped)
```

```
0xFF 0xFF 0xFF // row 1, pixel 1 R G B
0xFF 0xFF 0xFF // row 1, pixel 2 R G B
0xFF 0xFF 0xFF // row 1, pixel 3 R G B
0xFF 0xFF 0xFF // row 1, pixel 4 R G B
0xFF 0xFF 0xFF // row 2, pixel 1 R G B
0xFF 0xFF 0xFF // row 2, pixel 2 R G B
0xFF 0xFF 0xFF // row 2, pixel 3 R G B
0xFF 0xFF 0xFF // row 2, pixel 4 R G B
```

### Multiple Connections

`dmdserver` accepts muliple connections in parallel, but the last connection "wins".
That means that the data of the last client that connected get displayed. All previous connections from other cleints are "paused".
As soon as the last connection gets terminated by the client, the newest previous one becomes active again (if it is still active).
The "paused" connections aren't really paused. Their data is still accepted but dropped instead of dispalyed.

### Config File

```ini
[DMDServer]
# The address (interface) to listen for TCP connections.
Addr = localhost
# The port to listen for TCP connections.
Port = 6789
# Set to 1 if Serum colorization should be used, 0 if not.
AltColor = 1
# Overwrite the AltColorPath sent by the client and set it to a fixed value.
AltColorPath =
# Set to 1 if PUP DMD frame matching should be used, 0 if not.
PUPCapture = 1
# Overwrite the PUPVideosPath sent by the client and set it to a fixed value.
PUPVideosPath =
# Set to 1 if PUP DMD frame matching should respect the exact colors, 0 if not.
PUPExactColorMatch = 0

[ZeDMD]
# Set to 1 if ZeDMD is attached.
Enabled = 1
# Disable auto-detection and provide a fixed serial port.
Device =
# Set to 1 to enable ZeDMD debug mode.
Debug = 0
# Overwrite ZeDMD internal RGB order setting. Valid values are 0-5. -1 disables the setting.
# The RGB level could be set at any time, but since ZeDMD version 3.6.0, ZeDMD need to be
# rebooted to apply this the setting. So it is essential to set SaveSettings to 1 if a new
# RGBOrder should be applied.
RGBOrder = -1
# Overwrite ZeDMD internal brightness setting. Valid values are 0-15. -1 disables the setting.
# The brightness level could be adjust at runtime, SaveSettings set to 1 will save the setting
# in ZeDMD, too.
Brightness = -1
# Set to 1 to permantenly store the overwritten settings above in ZeDMD internally.
SaveSettings = 0

[Pixelcade]
# Set to 1 if Pixelcade is attached
Enabled = 1
# Disable auto-detection and provide a fixed serial port
Device =
